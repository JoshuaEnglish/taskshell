Tasker is another text-based file that adapts Gina Trapani's Todo.txt format and interface rules

Tasker is extensible through entry points, allowing users to write their own commands and utilities to manage tasks.

Tasker comes with two plugins:

  * checklist - manages multistep tasks that are repeated under different contexts (such as filing paperwork for a new employee)
  * quotidia - manages recurring tasks without cluttering the task list (such as "take out the trash every Wednesday")

Plugins are fairly simple to create.
